## Steps to build/run the application ##

## These steps I did in my machine, which runs Ubuntu
1. Run the AVD emulator

	$ cd /home/<user>/Android/Sdk/
	$ sudo emulator/emulator -avd <virtual_device_name>


2. Change the IP address in App.js

	# Change from 127.0.0.1 to the IP address used to run the server


3. Run the application

	# sudo npm run android
